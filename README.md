# randomImg
script i wrote cuz yes 👍
----------------------------------------------------
made using node.js 14.16.1 and puppeteer

script that generates a URL for a sketchy site i found, scrapes the screenshot for each page and saves it to the specified location

it can scrape as many images as you'd like (i guess), just change the number for the variable 'number' (line9, index.js)
